/*
Dart is an object-oriented language with classes and mixin-based inheritance

Every object is an instance of a class, and all classes except Null descend from Object

Mixin-based inheritance means that although every class (except for the top class, Object?) has exactly one superclass, a class body can be reused in multiple class hierarchies.

Extension methods are a way to add functionality to a class without changing the class or creating a subclass.

Class modifiers allow you to control how libraries can subtype a class.

Using  class members (.)
